                Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books
                and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's

                The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many
                others. The Marvel brand had been used over the years, but solidified as the company's
                only brand within a couple of years. </p>
